A design pattern is a general repeatable solution to a commonly occurring problem in software design. It's a template for solving a particular design problem in a specific context. Design patterns are not complete solutions; rather, they provide a structure for how to solve problems and offer best practices for designing maintainable and flexible software systems.

# There are three main categories of design patterns:

Creational Patterns: These patterns deal with object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation. They help in creating objects in a way that is flexible and avoids directly specifying the class of the object being created. Examples include Singleton, Factory Method, Abstract Factory, Builder, and Prototype.

Structural Patterns: These patterns focus on the composition of classes or objects to form larger structures and provide more advanced solutions for object composition. They help ensure that objects can work together and can be used to form larger structures with minimal changes. Examples include Adapter, Bridge, Composite, Decorator, Facade, Flyweight, and Proxy.

Behavioral Patterns: These patterns are concerned with the interaction between objects and how they collaborate. They capture communication patterns among objects and provide solutions for how objects can interact in a flexible manner. Examples include Chain of Responsibility, Command, Interpreter, Iterator, Mediator, Memento, Observer, State, Strategy, Template Method, and Visitor.

# Commonly Used Design Patterns:

Singleton Pattern: Ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance.

Factory Method Pattern: Defines an interface for creating objects but allows subclasses to decide which class to instantiate.

Adapter Pattern: Converts the interface of a class into another interface the client expects. It lets classes work together that otherwise couldn't due to incompatible interfaces.

Decorator Pattern: Attaches additional responsibilities to an object dynamically. It provides a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.

Observer Pattern: Defines a dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.

Strategy Pattern: Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. It lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.

Facade Pattern: Provides a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem. It defines a higher-level interface that makes the subsystem easier to use.

Template Method Pattern: Defines the structure of an algorithm in a base class but lets subclasses override specific steps of the algorithm without changing its structure.

These are just a few examples of design patterns. Each pattern addresses a specific problem and provides a proven solution. Design patterns enhance software development by providing reusable solutions to common design challenges, improving code quality, and promoting code that is easy to understand and maintain.
